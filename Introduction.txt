State the impact of changes in CO2 with the recent climate change, mention the importance of ob-
serving these changes with reliable data sets around the world, both from ground networks and
satellite measurements. Add key studies describing CO2 measurements with solar absorption FTIR,
describe the TCCON network and requirements, list previous studies of CO2 measurements in Mex-
ico.

(Primer parrafo)

During the last years, carbon dioxide (CO2) has exceeded the pre-industrial levels by about 40%, with fossil fuel 
combustion and land use change as the main contributors (Hartman et al., 2013).\

Studies done to estimate the CO2 concentrations in Mexico City have been scarce, the first one was conducted during 
1981 and 1982 and estimated the diurnal and seasonal variation taking air samples in different parts of the city 
(Baez et al., 1988). Two different campaigns (MCMA-2003, MILAGRO/MCMA-2006) have estimated the CO2 fluxes and 
concentrations during a regular day in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) using the eddy covariance technique 
(Velasco et al., 2005, Velasco et al., 2009). The first study using a FTS was done during September 2001 in the south 
of the MCMA using a Nicolet Nexus interferometer with a resolution of 0.125 cm-1 and retrieving CO2 in the 723-766 
spectral region. The emissions inventory for the MCMA estimated that the CO2 emissions for 2012 were 42.1 million of tons.

The importance of having datasets of CO2 concentrations around the world have been addressed by networks like GLOBALVIEW-CO2 
(GLOBALVIEW-CO2, 2013) and the Total Column Carbon Observing Network (TCCON). TCCON is a worldwide ground-based network of 
Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) that records solar absorption spectra in the near infrared (NIR) spectral region in 
order to retrieve column abundances of CO2, CH4 and other gases, providing reliable, long-term validation datasets for 
carbon cycle studies and satellite measurements.
